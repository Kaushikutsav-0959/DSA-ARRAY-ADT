Complete Dynamic Array ADT with sorting, searching, set ops, and rotations.
# Dynamic Array ADT (C++)

A dynamic and feature-rich Array Abstract Data Type implemented fully in C++.

Features
- Dynamic resizing (growth + shrink)
- Insert, append, delete
- Linear & Binary Search
- Sorting (Bubble), Sorted Insert
- Reverse, shifts & rotations
- Get / Set, Max / Min / Avg / Sum
- Full Set Operations
  - Union
  - Intersection
  - Difference
- Merge sorted arrays
- Operator Overloading:
  - `<<` to print array
  - `[]` for element access
